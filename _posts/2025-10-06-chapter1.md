<hr>

<p>
The author began by explaining that when he first started learning <b>C</b> and <b>C++</b>,  
he used a website called <a href="https://godbolt.org"><b>Godbolt</b></a> to view the small pieces of code he wrote  
and see the <b>Assembly</b> that the <b>Compiler</b> generated.  
This site helped him a lot in understanding how the compilation process works.

<h1 style="color: #9a3ba6; "><b>Optimization levels and debug information</b></h1>
<hr>

<p>
The author then explained that the code a programmer writes can be compiled using different <b>Compilers</b>,  
and each one can apply a different level of <b>optimization</b> to make the resulting code run faster.  
</p>

<p>
He mentioned that there are about <b>three optimization levels</b>.  
The first one — often referred to as <b>level 0</b> — means that no optimization is performed.  
This is typically used by a <b>compiler</b> in <b>Debug</b> mode,  
where the code is compiled exactly as written, without any performance adjustments.  
This level is especially useful when a programmer wants to perform <b>debugging</b>  
and trace the code step by step.
